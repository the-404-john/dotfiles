# Dotfiles
This repository contains my personal configuration files for setting up a Unix-based development environment. These dotfiles are tailored mainly for minimalism.

## Contents

- **Neovim** (`~/.config/nvim`) – Custom Neovim setup using Lua.
- **i3** (`~/.config/i3`) – Tiling window manager with custom keybindings and layout tweaks.
- **Alacritty** (`~/.config/alacritty`) – GPU-accelerated terminal emulator with personalized font and colors.
- **autorandr** (`~/.config/autorandr`) – Automatically switch display profiles based on connected monitors.
- **Zsh** (`~/.zshrc`) – Z shell setup with autocompletion and aliases.
